# FlappyBirdGame
I code a Flappy Bird game using pygame, it has a couple a functionalities. Check it out, it's not super complex, it took me like an hour to code, but it's pretty straight forward cause I didn't had a lot of experience with the module pygame. Btw, Unity'll always be better. New functionalities for the game comming!
